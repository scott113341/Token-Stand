# 1
`6.36mm` base  
`14.26mm` back  
`7.71mm` elevation


## 1-1
`6.36mm` base  
`14.26mm` back  
`7.71mm` elevation

* feels and looks very solid
* looks more elevated (good thing) than `1-2`, even though same elevation

### Tryler3D, Printrbot Simple Maker, High, PLA, White
* mass: `11g`


## 1-2
`4.95mm` base  
`15.68mm` back

shorter base, higher back
* doesn't look as solid as `1-1` but feels almost as good
* picking up token is easier on the thumb due to the extra protrusion
* higher back is not good for gripping back of token

### Tryler3D, Printrbot Simple Maker, High, PLA, White
* mass: `11g`


## 1-3
`1mm` rounded left cut edge (for sandstone printing)


## 1-4
like `1-3`, `5mm` instead of `1mm` fillet on the lip's circle-horizontal junction


## 1-5
`4.95mm` base  
`12.85mm` back

like `1-4`


## 1-6
like `1-5`, `1mm` shell


## 1-7
`14.71mm` elevation

like `1-6`, about same elevation as reference


## 1-8
`4.71mm` elevation

like `1-6`, minimum elevation


## 1-9 :star:
like `1-5`, right side shortened by `1mm`


## 1-10 :star:
`17.71mm` elevation

like `1-9`, `10mm` taller



# 2
`45°` angle

## 2-1
* had to print with support material
* nubs don't print well; not worth it


## 2-2
like `2-1`, without the nubs, instead a slot for a command strip

* too thin


## 2-3
`35°` angle

like `2-2`, thicker everywhere


## 2-4
like `2-3`, thicker everywhere, about `5.5mm` thickness

* back is not tall enough, token interferes with monitor


## 2-5 :star:
like `2-4`, correct back height


## 2-6 :star:
`45°` angle

like `2-5`, `45°` angle


## 2-7 :star:
`30°` angle

like `2-5`, `30°` angle


## 2-8 :star:
`60°` angle

like `2-5`, `60°` angle



# reference
`5.24mm` base  
`13.83mm` back  
`14.59mm` elevation
* easy to pick up token
* doesn't feel very stable

### Tryler3D, Printrbot Simple Maker, High, PLA, Black
* mass: `9g`
* token slides horizontally easily

### Tryler3D, Printrbot Simple Maker, High, PLA, White
* mass: `14g`
* glossier, more refined finish
* deformation on corners of circle cut
